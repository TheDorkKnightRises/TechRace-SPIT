    <string name="redbull_event">Red Bull Soapbox Race 2016</string>
    <string name="redbull_desc_short">Where Genius Meets Ridiculous</string>
    <string name="redbull_desc_long">The Red Bull Soapbox Race is an international event that started back in the year 2000, in Brussels. Since then, more than a hundred Red Bull Soapbox Races have been organised globally. India will host this one-of-a-kind event with all its craziness for a second time this year. In an outrageous downhill race, racers are welcomed to build their own soapbox and compete against gravity. Each of these hand-made machines have no engine on them. So how do I get to the finish line, you might ask? With a big push from your teammates, a little bit of luck and a big dollop of eccentricity! Back in 2012, people witnessed everything from a vadapav to a pizza slice roll down Mount Mary slope in the inaugural edition of Soapbox. This November, Red Bull Soapbox Race returns, and it promises to be bigger and better. So, are you in for the ride?
